This chapter describes how to install Apache Karaf Cave into an existing Apache Karaf instance.

== Pre-installation requirements

As Apache Karaf Cave is a Apache Karaf sub-project, it has to be installed into a running Apache Karaf instance.

Apache Karaf Cave is available as Apache Karaf features. The easiest way to install is just to have an internet
connection from the Apache Karaf running instance.

== Registration of the Apache Karaf Cave features

Simply register the Apache Karaf Cave features URL in your Apache Karaf instance:

----
karaf@root> features:addurl mvn:org.apache.karaf.cave/apache-karaf-cave/2.3.0/xml/features
----

Now Apache Karaf Cave features are available, ready to be installed:

----
karaf@root> features:list|grep -i cave
[uninstalled  ] [2.3.0 ] cave-server                   karaf-cave-2.3.0
----

=== Starting Apache Karaf Cave Server

The Apache Karaf Cave Server is installed by the _cave-server_ feature:

----
karaf@root> features:install cave-server
----

NB: installation of the cave-server feature will install additional features, such as obr, http, war. It could take
several minutes depending of your network connection speed.

New Apache Karaf Cave commands are now available:

----
karaf@root> cave:<TAB>
cave:repositories-list             cave:repository-create             cave:repository-install            cave:repository-populate
cave:repository-proxy              cave:repository-uninstall          cave:repository-update             cave:repository-upload-artifact
