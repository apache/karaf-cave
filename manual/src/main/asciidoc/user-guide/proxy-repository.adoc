= Proxy repository

As you can link:populate-repository.adoc[populate repository]

It means that the artifacts stay on the remote repository, Apache Karaf Cave generates the OBR metadata in the local repository
for the remote artifacts:

----
karaf@root> cave:repository-proxy my-repository http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/servicemix/bundles/org.apache.servicemix.bundles.commons-lang/
----

NB: the Cave repository will only handle the OBR metadata, it doesn't monitor the remote repository. It means that you
have to call the _cave:proxy-repository_ command each time the remote repository change (new artifacts, etc).

NB: a best practice is to create a Cave repository dedicated for each proxied repository.

The _cave:proxy-repository_ command accepts the filter option, as the _cave:populate-repository_ command:

----
karaf@root> cave:repository-proxy --filter .*joda-time-2.* my-repository http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/joda-time/joda-time
----
