== Proxy repository

As you can populate repository, you can also proxy an "external" repository.

It means that the artifacts stay on the remote repository, Apache Karaf Cave generates the repository metadata in the local repository
for the remote artifacts:

----
karaf@root()> cave:repository-proxy my-repository http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/servicemix/bundles/org.apache.servicemix.bundles.commons-lang/
----

NB: the Cave repository will only handle the repository metadata, it doesn't monitor the remote repository. It means that you
have to call the 'cave:proxy-repository' command each time the remote repository change (new artifacts, etc).

NB: a best practice is to create a Cave repository dedicated for each proxied repository.

The 'cave:repository-proxy' command accepts the filter option, as the 'cave:repository-populate' command:

----
karaf@root()> cave:repository-proxy --filter .*joda-time-2.* my-repository http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/joda-time/joda-time
----
