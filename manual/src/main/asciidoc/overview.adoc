= Apache Karaf Cave overview

Apache Karaf Cave is an Apache Karaf sub-project.

It provides an OSGi Bundle Repository (OBR) and Karaf Features Repository (KFR).

OBR provides a service that can automatically install a bundle, with its deployment dependencies, from a bundle
repository.

Apache Karaf Cave provides the following features:

* *Storage*: Karaf Cave includes a storage backend. The default one is a simple filesystem backend. As the Cave backend
is designed in a plugin way, you can implement your own backend (for instance, JDBC or LDAP backend).
* *OBR Metadata Generation*: Karaf Cave automatically creates the OBR metadata for you, using the artifacts presents
in the Cave repository storage.
* *OBR Registration*: Karaf Cave allows you to directly register a Cave repository into an OBR RepositoryAdmin OSGi
service.
* *Artifact Upload*: Users can upload OSGi bundle in a Cave repository. It supports URLs like mvn:groupId/artifactId/version,
file:, http:, etc.
* *Repository proxy*: Karaf Cave is able to proxy an existing repository, for instance an existing Maven repository.
The artifacts are located on the "external" repository, Cave handles the OBR metadata. Cave supports file: and http:
URLs, it means that Cave is able to browse a remote HTTP Maven repository for instance.
* *Repository population*: Karaf Cave is able to get artifacts present on an "external" repository (local file: or
remote http:), looking for OSGi bundles, and copy the artifacts in the Cave repository storage.

Karaf Cave provides two components:

* the cave-server is the OBR and KFR server, including the storage, the management layer, the REST service layer, etc.
* the cave-client is a local OBR service proxy that use a remote Cave OBR server (not yet available).
