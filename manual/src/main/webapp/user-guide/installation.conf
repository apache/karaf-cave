h1. Installation

This chapter describes how to install Apache Karaf Cave into an existing Apache Karaf instance.

h2. Pre-installation requirements

As Apache Karaf Cave is a Apache Karaf sub-project, it has to be installed into a running Apache Karaf instance.

Apache Karaf Cave is available as Apache Karaf features. The easiest way to install is just to have an internet
connection from the Apache Karaf running instance.

h2. Registration of the Apache Karaf Cave features

Simply register the Apache Karaf Cave features URL in your Apache Karaf instance:

{code}
karaf@root()> feature:repo-add mvn:org.apache.karaf.cave/apache-karaf-cave/3.0.0/xml/features
{code}

Now Apache Karaf Cave features are available, ready to be installed:

{code}
karaf@root()> feature:list |grep -i cave
cave-server                   | 3.0.0   | x         | karaf-cave-3.0.0 |
{code}

h3. Starting Apache Karaf Cave Server

The Apache Karaf Cave Server is installed by the {{cave-server}} feature:

{code}
karaf@root()> feature:install cave-server
{code}

NB: installation of the cave-server feature will install additional features, such as obr, http, war. It could take
several minutes depending of your network connection speed.

New Apache Karaf Cave commands are now available:

{code}
karaf@root()> cave:<TAB>
cave:repositories            cave:repository-create       cave:repository-destroy
cave:repository-install      cave:repository-populate     cave:repository-proxy
cave:repository-uninstall    cave:repository-update       cave:repository-upload
{code}
