h1. Repository

A Cave Repository is a container for:

* OSGi bundles (jar files)
* OBR (OSGi Bundle Repository) metadata (aka a repository.xml file)

By default, a repository uses a filesystem backend for the storage, the directory used is KARAF_BASE/cave.

You can change the storage location in the {{etc/org.apache.karaf.cave.server.storage.cfg}} configuration file:

#
# Storage location where Apache Karaf Cave create repositories by default
#
storage.location=cave
{code}

For instance, you can define {{/var/cave/store}} for the {{storage.location}} property.

h2. Create

The {{cave:repository-create}} command creates a new repository:

{code}
karaf@root> cave:repository-create my-repository
{code}

A repository is identified by a name, {{my-repository}} in our example.

Apache Karaf Cave creates the repository storage for you.

If you want to use an existing directory, and avoid Cave to create one in the storage location, you can use the {{-l}}
({{--location}}) option:

{code}
karaf@root> cave:repository-create -l /home/user/.m2/repository m2
{code}

By default, Apache Karaf Cave scans the repository storage and create the OBR metadata. You can use the {{-no}} ({{--no-obr-generate}})
option to avoid this step:

{code}
karaf@root> cave:repository-create -no -l /home/user/.m2/repository m2
{code}

By default, Apache Karaf Cave registers (installs) a new repository into the OBR service. You can use the {{-ni}} ({{--no-install}})
option to avoid this step:

{code}
karaf@root> cave:repository-create -ni -l /home/user/m2/repository m2
{code}

NB: the {{-no}} and {{-ni}} options are interesting when you use an existing location for the repository. If you create a
new empty repository, these options don't have really any effect.

h2. List

You can list the repositories:

{code}
karaf@root> cave:repositories-list
Name                 Location
[my-repository]      [/opt/apache-karaf-2.3.3/cave/my-repository]
[m2]                 [/home/user/.m2/repository]
{code}

You can find the repository name and location.

h2. Repository and OBR service

By default, Apache Karaf Cave installs the repository in the Apache Karaf OBR service.

You can see the installed repositories using the {{obr:listurl}} command:

{code}
karaf@root> obr:listurl
file:/home/jbonofre/.m2/repository/repository.xml
file:/home/jbonofre/apache-karaf-2.3.3/cave/my-repository/repository.xml
{code}

You can refresh a repository or install a repository in the OBR service using the {{cave:repository-install}} command:

{code}
karaf@root> cave:repository-install my-repository
{code}

You can uninstall a repository from the Apache Karaf OBR service using the {{cave:repository-uninstall}} command:

{code}
karaf@root> cave:repository-uninstall my-repository
{code}

You can see with the {{obr:listurl}} command that the repository is no more known by the OBR service:

{code}
karaf@root> obr:listurl
file:/home/jbonofre/.m2/repository/repository.xml
{code}

You can "re-install" the repository at any time using the {{cave:repository-install}} command again:

{code}
karaf@root> cave:repository-install my-repository
karaf@root> obr:listurl
file:/home/jbonofre/.m2/repository/repository.xml
file:/home/jbonofre/apache-karaf-2.3.3/cave/my-repository/repository.xml
{code}

At any time, you can force the generation and update of the OBR metadata using the {{cave:repository-update}} command:

{code}
karaf@root> cave:repository-update my-repository
{code}

This command scan the repository storage location, seeking all OSGi bundles, and generate the OBR metadata (aka a repository.xml).

NB: If you add or remove any artifact in the repository storage location by hand (for instance, using cp, rm, etc on Unix),
you have to update the repository OBR metadata using the {{cave:repository-update}} command.

h2. Destroy

The {{cave:repository-destroy}} command deletes the repository storage location:

{code}
karaf@root> cave:repository-destroy my-repository
{code}

{warning}
Be aware that this command completely deletes the repository storage. By extremely careful when using this command
with repository using "custom" location.
{warning}

h2. What's next

Apache Karaf Cave provides a HTTP service to expose the repositories. It allows you to use the repositories remotely.
You can find details in the [HTTP wrapper service section|http-wrapper] of the user guide.

If repositories are installed in the OBR service, you can use the OBR command as explained in the [OBR commands section|obr-command]
of the user guide.
